### About this course

Going FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) is a growing effort in the training communities. In this training session, we present an extract of the co-created ELIXIR-BE and ELIXIR-SE course - FAIR training material by design - that is embedded in the ELIXIR Training Platform offering. Focusing on the ‘R’ of the FAIR practice, our objective is to demonstrate and guide participants into trying out a few steps to create Reusable material. Although our main focus is to create reusable material by design, we reflect on it from two complementary perspectives: on one hand the initiative of making it reusable and secondly the practice of reusing other materials. By doing this, we empower participants in creating and reusing training material while actively and critically thinking about their efforts in a FAIR way.

We will discuss, exemplify and give opportunities to participants to look into different aspects of Reusability. Activities are thought to increase the technical skills and discerning mindset during the development of a new training course. By the session’s conclusion, participants should be able to incorporate aspects of reusability in their fresh training material as much as FAIRifing aspects regarding reusability of existing resources.
